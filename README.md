# Custom PHP Framework
I'm creating a PHP framework from scratch, and trying to respect coding standards, PSR standards (like using the PSR-7 Request / Response interface).
I'm also trying Unit testing with PHPUnit, and doing a lot of **TDD** (Test driven development)

It's based from the course made by [@Grafikart](https://github.com/Grafikart/).
